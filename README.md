# Covenant-Tech-Club-Website
I've been the president of Covenant College's technology club since September 2014. When I first took over the website was hosted on a local Covenant server and ran with PHP/MySQL as the backend. I've converted the website in its entirety to ASP.NET to make it much more dynamic.
